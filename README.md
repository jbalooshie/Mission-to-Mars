# Mission-to-Mars
## Project Purpose and Summary
The purpose of this project was to write a scraping program using Python, use MongoDB to store the scraped data, and then use Flask to build a website that can display the scraped data. Various information about Mars was scraped using a Python script from several different websites. The data scraped included the most recent news headline and summary about NASA's Mars Mission, a "featured image", facts about Mars, weather on Mars, and pictures of Mars' hemispheres. This data was then stored in a MongoDB database to be accessed by our Flask application. A Flask app was then created that would visualize the information that had been scraped. The app also includes a button to scrape for new data, and update the images and stories with the most recent ones. Finally the app was customized using bootstrap to make it visually appealing, and to display on both desktop and mobile devices.
